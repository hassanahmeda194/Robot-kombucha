                            <p class="w-75">Organic means less emissions - less CO2 into our atmosphere, and all of us
                                at ROBOT are
                                determined to focus on a better system for us all. So our organic honey cola kombucha is
                                made from
                                only the finest organic ingredients - sourced locally. Including the high quality
                                natural organic
                                honey - harvested from our own bee hives. This ensures that we cut out GM addictive and
                                highly
                                processed refined white sugar! One of the most addictive and most destructive
                                ingredients on planet
                                earth. By using honey, we use less to achieve that delicious sweet taste - but it is a
                                natural
                                sweetness - full of antioxidants, omega 3’s and anti-inflammatory qualities. Honey has
                                so many
                                incredible health benefits - we think it is the perfect ingredient for our kombucha
                                Cola.</p>

                            <p class="w-75">Our organic honey cola kombucha strikes the perfect balance between
                                sweetness and
                                acidity - creating a delicious and refreshing kombucha drink which is neither too sweet
                                nor too
                                tart. It is a hand-crafted drink which will suit a majority of tastes - and it is just
                                superb as an
                                organic mixer in mocktails and cocktails!</p>

                        <p class="w-75">Unlike traditional colas that rely on highly refined sugar to boost the
                            sweetness - as well
                            as artificial chemical sweeteners like aspartame, ROBOT Honey Cola Kombucha - is sweetened
                            with pure
                            organic honey. This not only enhances the flavour, but also provides a much healthier
                            alternative for
                            those who are looking to reduce their sugar intake.</p>
